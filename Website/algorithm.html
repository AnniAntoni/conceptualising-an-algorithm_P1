<h1>Our Algorithm</h1>
<p>Deciding what cereals to buy can be a nightmare if you don't know where to start. Our solution will make it easier to decide by narrowing down the choices. The algorithm provides a curated list of recommended cereals according to user preferences. </p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>There are four main attributes in our algorithm based on the dataset we curated:</p> 
  <list>
    <li><b>type of cereal, string, "hot" or "cold"</b> Initial user preference of whether the user prefers hot cereal or cold cereal for breakfast</li> 
    <li><b>calories per serving, integer, 50</b> Defines how important calory intake is for the user, can help in finding low calory options if it is important</li> 
    <li><b>sugar content, float, 6.7</b> Is it important for the user that the cereals are sweet? If not let's suggest healthier options.</li>
    <li><b>fibre, float, 4.5</b> is our fourth attribute for the ones who need help with their gut health i.e fibre intake: </li>
  </list>
